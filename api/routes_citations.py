"""citing the library from inside a paper project.

Mounted under the papers router, so every path here is
``/api/papers/projects/{project_id}/citations``.

Two routes, because the editor asks two different questions:

    GET   what could I cite, and what key would each one have
    POST  I picked that one -- put it in references.bib and tell me its key

The GET is what fills the dropdown as the author types, so it answers for the
whole library at once and never writes. The POST is the commitment, and it is
the only place a key becomes permanent.
