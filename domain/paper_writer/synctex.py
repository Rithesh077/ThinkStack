"""Source line to page position, and back.

Every compile already runs with `--synctex`, so every project on disk carries a
`main.synctex.gz` that TeX wrote and nothing has ever read. The only code that
touched the file hid it from the project tree. This reads it.

WHAT THE FILE IS. A gzipped text log of boxes. After a small header giving the
unit and the input files, the body is one record per box:

    [1,24:4736287,52610785:29685704,47874498,0
    ^ ^  ^  ^       ^         ^        ^      ^
    |  \\  \\   \\       \\         \\        \\      depth
    |   \\  \\   \\       \\         \\        height
    |    \\  \\   \\       \\         width
    |     \\  \\   \\       y
    |      \\  \\   x
    |       \\  line in the source
    |        input file tag
    box kind

`{n` opens page n and `}n` closes it. Coordinates are TeX scaled points, and
there are 65536 of them to a point and 72.27 points to an inch -- so a PDF
viewer working in CSS pixels at 96 dpi wants sp / 65536 / 72.27 * 96.

WHY PARSE IT HERE rather than reach for a library. The format is a dozen lines
of text and the two questions this application asks of it are the two simplest
ones it answers. A dependency would be larger than the parser, and it would be
another compiled thing to carry into a bundle built for three operating
systems -- the argument that already retired ChromaDB and d3-force.

WHAT IT CANNOT DO, stated because the alternative is a feature that lies. TeX
records where a BOX went, not where a character went, so the answer is a line
and a rectangle rather than a column and a caret. A line that produced no box --
a comment, a blank, a macro that expanded to nothing -- has no position at all,
and the honest reply is the nearest line that did.
