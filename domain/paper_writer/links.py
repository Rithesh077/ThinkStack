"""Files a project uses that do not live inside it.

Everything in `files.py` is project-relative on purpose: `safe_path()` resolves
a name and refuses anything that lands outside the project. That is right for
what it does, and it is exactly why this is a separate module rather than a
loosening of it. A linked file is a different thing with different rules, and
mixing the two would mean the boundary that protects the workspace now has an
exception in it.

── Referenced, not copied ──

A link records where a file IS. It does not take a copy, for the same reason
imported models are referenced rather than copied: a user with a 40MB PDF should
not acquire a second one because the application preferred a tidy folder, and a
.bib shared between three projects should be one file that stays in step.
Copying is available as a deliberate act -- `copy_into_project` -- for anyone who
wants a project that travels as a unit.

The cost of that choice is accepted rather than overlooked: a referenced file
can move. Which is the rest of this module.

── Finding it again ──

Every link stores the path AND the operating system's identity for the file:
`st_dev` and `st_ino`. That pair survives a rename and a move within a
filesystem, so a user who reorganises their documents does not silently lose
half a project. Resolution, in order:

    the stored path still holds a file        -> use it, refresh the identity
    the path is gone, the identity is nearby  -> use it, and remember the path
    neither                                   -> say so, and ask once

"Nearby" is deliberately small: the folders this project's other links sit in,
their parents, and one level of subdirectory beneath those. That catches a
rename, a drop into `figures/`, and a move beside a sibling chapter. It does not
walk the filesystem -- searching a home directory while somebody waits is worse
than asking them where the file went, and the ask is already built.

What this cannot do is worth stating, since the alternative is pretending: a
copy has a different identity and is a different file; a move to another
filesystem does not preserve an inode; and an editor that saves by writing a
temporary file and renaming it over the original produces a new identity for
what the author considers the same document. The first case in the list handles
that last one, which is why path is tried before identity rather than after.

Content hashing would survive all three. It also costs a full read of every file
on every check and cannot tell two copies of the same document apart, which for
a bibliography shared between projects is precisely the wrong answer.

    ── Why a file is filtered by suffix and a folder is not ──

    For a FILE the suffix allowlist is load-bearing rather than tidy. This is
    the one place the application takes an absolute path from its caller, and
    restricting it to what a LaTeX project can use is what keeps the things
    worth stealing unreachable: `~/.ssh/id_rsa` has no suffix, and neither does
    `/etc/passwd`.

    A FOLDER cannot be filtered that way -- a directory has no extension -- so
    it earns its safety differently: nothing here ever reads or serves the
    contents of a linked folder. It is a remembered location, for the author to
    point `\graphicspath` at and for `copy_into_project` to duplicate on an
    explicit instruction. That is why the raw endpoint refuses a folder rather
    than listing it: a browsable remote directory is a much larger thing to
    offer than a remembered one, and it is not what a paper needs.
