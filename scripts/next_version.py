"""Work out the next version number, so nobody has to remember or guess it.

The rules, stated once:

    a fix/ landing     -> X.Y.Z -> X.Y.(Z+1)      Z is unbounded
    a feat/ landing    -> X.Y.Z -> X.(Y+1).0      the branch name is the claim
    at Y=9, a feature  -> X.9.Z -> (X+1).0.0      Y carries into X at ten
    --bump major       -> X.Y.Z -> (X+1).0.0      a decision, taken by a human

The branch name is the claim. Naming a branch feat/ says "this adds something",
and the person naming it is the one who knows; that judgement is made once, at
the moment it is true, rather than reconstructed later from a list of merges.

X is not inferred from anything. "This is a new generation of the product" is
not a claim a branch name can make, so only the release workflow moves it.

"Current" means the newest published STABLE tag (vX.Y.Z), not whatever happens
to sit in tauri.conf.json, because that file is only bumped as part of cutting a
release and is therefore behind between releases.

The kind can be given, or inferred from the commit subjects since that tag using
the conventional-commit prefixes this project already uses. Inference is
deliberately conservative: anything it cannot classify counts as a fix, so an
unclear history produces a patch bump rather than an inflated one.

The BASE is the newest tag across every channel, stable or beta, so the number
can never go backwards. Basing it on the newest STABLE tag is how it did: beta
was testing 1.6.7 while the newest stable was 1.0.0, so a patch bump computed
from stable produced 1.0.1.

--next replays what has landed: each feat/ or fix/ BRANCH MERGE since that tag
applies one bump, oldest first. Direct commits do not move the version, and
neither do chore/ or docs/ branches.

usage:
    next_version.py --next            # replay the merges since the newest tag
    next_version.py --explain --next  # ... and show each one
    next_version.py --bump minor      # force a specific bump
    next_version.py --infer           # classify the commits, then bump
    next_version.py --current         # the newest version, bare

# minor is declared, not with the radix.

# nobody imports. What the number is actually for here is telling a user how

        anything else            -> ignored (chore/, docs/, release merges)

    One rule for both kinds, deliberately; see the comment on the branch test
    below for why a feature does not move Y. This docstring said
    "feat -> minor, and the patch resets" long after that stopped being true,
    which is a good way to spend an afternoon reading the wrong mechanism.

    Direct commits never move the version. A merge is the moment work lands,
    and counting the commits inside it as well would bump the number several
    times for one piece of work.

    Replayed in the order the merges actually happened, because the order
    changes the answer: a fix then a feature gives X.(Y+1).0, while a feature
    then a fix gives X.(Y+1).1.

    Deliberately NOT --first-parent. Work lands on dev, and dev is then merged
    into beta -- from beta's mainline that is a single "Merge branch 'dev'",
    with every feat/ and fix/ merge hanging off the SECOND parent and therefore
    invisible. Replaying beta that way returned the version that was already
    published, so the build advertised a number testers already had and the
    updater correctly refused to offer it. Every merge reachable since the tag
    is counted instead; each merge commit appears exactly once in that range,
    so nothing is double counted.

    NOTE: this requires merges to be real merge commits. A fast-forward merge
    creates none, so the branch name is lost and the landing is invisible here.
    scripts/promote.sh and the merge guide both use --no-ff for that reason.
