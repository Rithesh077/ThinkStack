# thinkstack: fetch the TeX engine we ship, and pre-warm its package cache.
#
# The paper writer needs a TeX engine. Requiring users to install MacTeX or
# MiKTeX made the flagship feature fail on every machine that was not a
# developer's -- that is a missing dependency, not a documentation problem.
#
# Tectonic is a single self-contained binary (~58 MB) that fetches LaTeX
# packages on demand. Fetching at runtime would break the offline promise, so
# this compiles a document using every package the writer's preamble loads and
# ships the resulting cache (~47 MB). A user's first compile then needs no
# network.
#
# Used by BOTH scripts/build.sh and .github/workflows/_build-desktop.yml, so a
# local build and a CI build bundle the same thing. Needs network; everything
# it produces is offline.
#
# usage: scripts/fetch-tex.sh [dest]        (default: data/tex)

# 0.15.0, not the newest. The 0.17.0 Linux build requires GLIBC_2.39, which
# is newer than Ubuntu 22.04 (2.35) and newer than a great many user machines:
# it failed to load at all on the CI runner, taking 15ms to not run, which is
# what left the shipped engine without a package cache. 0.15.0 needs only
# GLIBC_2.35 and links no OpenSSL 1.1 (which 0.14.1 does, and which modern
# distributions no longer ship). It supports every flag used here and produces
# a cache half the size.

# The engine retries an individual file a few times and then stops, so the
