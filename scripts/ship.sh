# thinkstack: ship what beta has been testing, to production, in one command.
#
# This existed as two steps -- `promote.sh release` to merge, then a separate
# `gh workflow run release.yml` to actually publish -- and the gap between them
# is not theoretical: a merge to main was done, the dispatch was not, and main
# sat un-released while everyone assumed it had shipped. Merging and publishing
# are one intention, so they are one command.
#
# usage:
#   scripts/ship.sh              # version derived from what landed on beta
#   scripts/ship.sh 2.2.0        # or state it
#   scripts/ship.sh --dry-run    # show every step, change nothing
#   scripts/ship.sh --yes        # skip the confirmation
#
# What it refuses to do, and why each one has happened:
#
#   * ship from a dirty tree           -- you cannot reproduce what you shipped
#   * ship when beta == main           -- there is nothing to release
#   * ship when beta's build is red    -- promoting a failed build to users
#   * ship a version <= the published  -- the updater only moves forward, so a
#                                         lower number is invisible to everyone
#                                         who already has the higher one, and
#                                         nothing about the release says so
#   * ship a tag that already exists   -- a second dispatch of the same version
#
# The last one matters most. release.yml accepts any version handed to it with
# no ordering check at all, so `-f version=1.0.0` today would tag it, publish
# it as "latest", and quietly present every user with a downgrade.
