# architecture decision records (adr)

## 2026-06-19: secure p2p networking layer
**decision:** adopt libp2p and public key infrastructure (pki) for user-to-user document sharing.
**rationale:** think stack is a privacy-first tool. rather than hosting user papers on a central database, users will serve files directly from their desktop instances. access is granted based on cryptographic signatures verified between peers.
**status:** accepted.

## 2026-06-19: migration to tauri desktop architecture
**decision:** bundle the entire python backend and frontend into a single native desktop application using tauri and sidecars.
**rationale:** running local ai models and a latex compiler requires direct hardware access, unrestricted file i/o, and bypassing browser sandboxes. tauri allows us to write the ui in react while maintaining native performance and minimal memory overhead compared to electron.
**status:** accepted.

## 2026-06-16: project renaming
**decision:** renamed the project from `scholarlens` to `think stack`.
**rationale:** the project scope has evolved into a broader, edge-ai focused research assistant and paper writer.
**status:** accepted.

## 2026-06-17: backend infrastructure audit & fixes
**decision 1:** renamed `chromadb_client.py` to `local_vector_store.py`.
**rationale:** the module did not use chromadb. it was a custom numpy-based cosine similarity implementation. the new name accurately reflects its function.

**decision 2:** added gbnf grammar to `llama_cpp` client.
**rationale:** prevented the llm from outputting conversational filler before json. this strict enforcement stops `json.loads()` crashes in downstream analysis modules, and lays the groundwork for forcing valid latex generation.

**decision 3:** added gpu fallback.
**rationale:** on machines where vram is insufficient (oom errors), the model will gracefully fallback to cpu-only inference rather than crashing the application.

## 2026-06-23: AI-assisted paper writer implementation
**decision:** implement the paper editor and compiler workflow as a core integrated component in the Tauri desktop application.
- **editor:** integrate CodeMirror as a lightweight, performant monospaced code editor within the React frontend of the Tauri desktop app.
- **file format:** use `.ths` (ThinkStack) extension representing raw user input/prompts. When generating, the local AI translates these prompts in-place to compilable LaTeX code.
- **compiler:** use system `pdflatex` to compile LaTeX code into a PDF, running two compiler passes to properly generate cross-references/indexes.
- **diagnostics:** parse `pdflatex` logs on compilation failure to extract clean, readable errors and present them directly under the editor.
- **testing:** create a standalone, automated unit and integration test suite (`scripts/test_paper_writer.py`) that tests all domain compiler operations and boots the FastAPI server to test API endpoints.
**status:** accepted.
