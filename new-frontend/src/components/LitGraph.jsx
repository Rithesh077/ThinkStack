 * a gap was about, whether a theme and a cluster were the same thing.

 * The papers a gap cites, each showing the passage the gap rests on.

 * A gap is a claim ABOUT several papers, so the useful view of it is the same
 * claim seen in each of them.
 *
 * The text is fetched through the shared cache, so opening a gap warms the
 * reader for exactly the papers you are about to open from it.
